    <h1>My Blender Project: Recreating Moab???</h1>
    
    <div class="process">
        <p>So basically, I started this whole Blender project with the idea of recreating my computer's background. It's a shot of Moab with a bike shadow, and I just love that image from the trip. Plus, I thought shadows in Blender would be a neat effect to play with.</p>
        
        <p>I started off trying to make a mountain from a cube, but that didn't feel right, so I scrapped it.</p>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <p><span class="time">Saturday 7:00 pm to way too late</span> - I moved to designing a bike. I found a YouTube tutorial, but honestly, it was kind of tough and not super beginner-friendly, so it took me a few days.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <p><span class="time">Sunday at 9:10 pm</span> - <span class="despair">Despair set in</span> as I wasn't done with a single object - thought about trying to make the claim a bike is 3 objects (a frame and two tires) - I gave up on the YouTube video and went rough.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <p><span class="time">Monday</span> - I start on my car - no video just gut action here. Starting with a cube and using a mirror reflection so both sides matched.</p>

        <div class="timeline-item">
            <p><span class="time">Monday at 4:30</span> - I tried out ATV landscape and wanted to cry.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Honestly, this whole thing has felt pretty tough as a newbie, and I'm still figuring out what my third object will be—maybe a tree instead of a mountain. We'll see.</p>
