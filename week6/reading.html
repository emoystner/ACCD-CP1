                    I love the challenge in this quote - it really brings out the point of the importance of usability and the importance of the value a product has, and that the value is not just found in its design. Is it thinking about the product holistically? Is it user-friendly? Is it helpful? You could have a beautiful search screen design, but if it didn't search as well as Google, then why would people use it?

                    "Design systems are especially interesting today, because digital products are systems, and designers who code are no longer confined to the creation of design systems that end up in printed manuals. Code allows designers to not just create designs, but build digital systems that create designs."

                    Love this - design systems are something I am super interested in. Though very intimidating and overwhelming to think about at the beginning. You cannot underestimate their value though!!

                    "Why did Apple make a highly produced prototype when the previous examples show that a rapid paper storyboard or a sketchy interactive prototype were sufficient for designing a role and telling a usage story? The answer lies in the kind of audience. The tape was shown publicly and to Apple employees as a vision of the future of computing. Thus the audience of the Knowledge Navigator was very broadâ€”including almost anyone in the world. Each of the two previous role design prototypes was shown to an audience which was well informed about the design project."

                <div class="response">
                    The Knowledge Navigator was a very compelling prototype. It does a great job of storytelling. The insight into who the audience is was very helpful to think about the purpose and what is needed depending on who you are talking to.

                    "If the role is well understood, but the goal of the artifact is to present its functionality in a novel way, then prototyping must focus on how the artifact will look and feel. If the artifact's functionality is to be based on a new technique, questions of how to implement the design may be the focus of prototyping efforts."

                    This quote effectively breaks down the different focuses prototyping can have depending on what aspects of the design are already established versus what needs to be explored. It provides a clear framework for deciding where to invest prototyping efforts.

                    I loved this example because it feels so simple and familiar. An easy way to show that prototypes can be simple to the point. I am so used to doing hi-fi, this is refreshing!

                    "It is important to know these rules when working with color, as they enable designers to create graphics that are accessible to a majority of users. However, to master the art of color combination, designers also have to know how color is used in different cultures and contexts, observe current trends in the arts, and develop a personal style based on this knowledge. Because of this, many authors have struggled to create good ways of teaching designers how to think about color combination."

                    Color theory is so interesting. This quote does a good job of holding the tension of the rules but also all of the other factors (cultures/styles). Definitely something I want to look more into.
