            <div class="story-text">
                <p>The goal was simple, yet deceptively complex: create the perfect COROS 3D watch in Blender. 
                Armed with determination and a real COROS watch on my wrist, I embarked on what would become 
                an epic journey of self-discovery through the lens of 3D modeling.</p>
                
                <p>I started with the watch face—a task that filled me with genuine joy. Using the skills I had 
                learned, I dove in headfirst, scaling, beveling, and expanding with the confidence of someone 
                who had found their rhythm. Each vertex moved with purpose, each edge loop placed with intention. 
                This was it—I was creating something from nothing, and it felt magnificent.</p>

                <p>Then came the buttons.</p>
                
                <p>Oh, the buttons.</p>
                
                <p>My own COROS watch sat there on my wrist, mocking me with its intricate details. 
                "Look at these perfectly crafted buttons," it seemed to whisper. "Look at the subtle 
                bevels, the precise indentations, the way each detail catches the light."</p>
                
                <p>My attempts were nothing short of digital torture:</p>
                
                <ul class="struggle-list">
                    <li>Adding objects to delete parts of the main object—a Boolean nightmare</li>
                    <li>Hours spent tweaking, only to realize I'd made it worse</li>
                    <li>The painful realization that sometimes, trying harder isn't the answer</li>
                    <li>Abandoning the project for days, defeated but not broken</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>I gave up. Not once, but multiple times. Each return to the project brought the same 
                result—no better, no closer to those perfect buttons that taunted me from my wrist.</p>

                <p>Then class came, and with it, a revelation that hit like lightning: I was trying too hard.</p>
                
                <p>Sometimes, the path to perfection isn't through suffering—it's through strategic resourcefulness. 
                I discovered BlenderKit, and with it, a beautiful watch model that would become my salvation:</p>

                    The Model That Saved My Sanity →
                </a>
                
                <p>With surgical precision, I broke it apart using vertices, extracting the band and those 
                elusive buttons. Finally, I had my high-fidelity watch—a creation that made my overachiever 
                heart sing with joy!</p>
                
                <p>The lesson wasn't about giving up; it was about working smarter, not harder. About knowing 
                when to leverage resources and when to build from scratch.</p>

                understanding of the creative process itself. Sometimes the greatest achievement isn't in 
                doing everything yourself—it's in knowing when to adapt, when to persist, and when to find 
                a better way.</p>
